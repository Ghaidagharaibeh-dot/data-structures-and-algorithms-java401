# Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.


## Code challenge 35

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- add vertex

- add edge

- get vertices

- get neighbors

- size

## Approach and Efficiency

1) add vertex

- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(1)

2) add edge
- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(1)

3) get Vertices

- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(n) ---> n: is the number of Vertices

3) get neighbors

- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(n) ---> n: is the number of neighbor Vertices

5) size

- Time: O(n) n: is the number of neighbor Vertices
- Space: O(1)

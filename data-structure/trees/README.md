
# Trees

## Code challenge 15
This challenge was to traverse a binary search tree and create include and contains methods.

### New Implementations :
Nodes
Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach is simple we compare the node data and add nodes to the tree based on if the data is larger (to the right node) or smaller(to the left node) than the data of the current node
- Time complexity O(log(n))
 -  Space O(1)

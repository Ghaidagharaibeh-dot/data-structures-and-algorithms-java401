
# Trees

# Code challenge 15
This challenge was to traverse a binary search tree and create include and contains methods.

###  Implementations :
Nodes
Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach is simple we compare the node data and add nodes to the tree based on if the data is larger (to the right node) or smaller(to the left node) than the data of the current node
- Time complexity O(log(n))
- Space O(1)





# Code challenge 16

Implemented a max method that returns an integer, Saved the traversed data into a list and loop through the list and find the maximum value and return it.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Space O(n) Time O(n)

## Solution
Make an object of the Binary Tree and add elements to it.
Call the max method to find the maximum value in the tree.

# Hash Table Implementation
A hash table is a data structure and it is an array of list. Each list is known as a bucket. The position of the bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method

# Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class

# API
- ```add(K key, V value)```: add the key and value pair to the table.

- ```get(K key)```: Returns value associated with that key in the table

- ```contains```: Returns boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

- ```remove(K key)```: remove the value from the table based on the key.

-```isEmpty()```: check the hash table is empty or not.

# Hashmap LEFT JOIN CC33
Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps.

## Challenge
Write a method called leftJoin accepts two hash
maps as a parameters and return a single data structure.
It will add the first hash map to the list and then loop 
through second hash map to check if the key is in the list,
if it exist in the list it will add the value of the key to the
same key in the list.

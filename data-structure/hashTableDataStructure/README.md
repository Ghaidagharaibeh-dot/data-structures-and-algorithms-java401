# Hash Table Implementation
A hash table is a data structure and it is an array of list. Each list is known as a bucket. The position of the bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method

# Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class

# API
- ```add(K key, V value)```: add the key and value pair to the table.

- ```get(K key)```: Returns value associated with that key in the table

- ```contains```: Returns boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

- ```remove(K key)```: remove the value from the table based on the key.

-```isEmpty()```: check the hash table is empty or not.
